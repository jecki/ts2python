Welcome to ts2python's documentation!
=====================================

ts2python is a transpiler that converts TypeScript-interfaces to Python
records like TypedDict and provides runtime json-validation against those
interfaces/TypedDicts. 

(In the future also other record structures like
pydantic or attr might be supported by ts2python as well.)
