Verison 0.7.6
-------------
- Typescript Records are not translated to Dict[]-types
- Omitted semicolons do not cause the parser to fail, anymore


Version 0.7.5
-------------
- bugfixes related to comments
- bugs #21, #19
- several changes to make ts2python digest the current vscode.d.ts

Version 0.7.4
-------------
- comments can be preserved: option "-k" or "--comments". Exception:
  Inline comments, e.g. "dog /* my little dog */: int", will not be preserved

Version 0.7.3
-------------
- better packaging


Version 0.7.2
-------------
- bugfixes
- more advanced types supported (by the parser only! which
  means they are read but may not be translated to Python
  very well)

Version 0.7.1
-------------
- rendering of anonymous interfaces as toplevel-TypedDicts now
  possible (use switch -a toplevel) to avoid error messages by
  type checkers
- added rudimentary support for more advanced types, e.g.
  "type Exact<T extends { [key: string]: unknown }> = { [K in keyof T]: T[K] }"
  Caveat: Not all of these constructs are supported and, if they are supported,
  they will appear strongly simplified on the Python side, often simply by
  using "Any". But at least some of the constructs will be parsed, now.


Version 0.6.9
-------------
- read (but ignore) TypeScript imports
- add alternative ways to render anonymous interfaces as TypedDicts:
  Apart from "local" (default), now "functional" and "type" can
  be selected. "type" is still experimental


Version 0.6.8
-------------

- Use of NotRequired (PEP 655) instead of "Optional" is now default.
- typeddict_shim is not needed, anymore, for Python 3.11 and above.
- compatibility with DHParser 1.4.2
